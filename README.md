#WTA Trip Report Scraper

This is a fun personal project to scrape all the trip reports and hikes from Washington Trail Assocation's incredible library of hikes and trip reports. The intent of the project is to capture the data for additional custom analysis.

_The current state of the project is that it works to capture reports, hikes, and regions._
